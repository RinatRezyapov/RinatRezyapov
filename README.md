Hello there, I'm Rinat! 👋

I'm a front-end developer in a constant state of learning and exploring new things.

Here is what I'm up to:

- :office: Front-end Team Lead at **[InCountry](https://incountry.com)**, building portal for data residency-as-a-service start-up
- :rocket: Coding with **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** / **[Next.js](https://https://nextjs.org/)** / Deep diving into JAM Stack
- :book: Writing articles in my **[blog](https://rrezyapov.com/)** built with **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)**
- :snowboarder: In a free time, I like to shredding the slopes and hitting the pow with my Burton Blunt
